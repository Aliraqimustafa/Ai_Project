We use fastai dataset , you can download dataset form this page : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitjain007/dog-vs-cat-fastai

We train model in google cloab and we download data using Kaggle api , We use the tensorflow & Keras api and we use the CNN to training model . 

## What do you need to run it ? 

1- Download Datasets using Kaggle api or from this page https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitjain007/dog-vs-cat-fastai

2- Prior knowledge of how CNN works 

3- Run 'classification_Dog_vs_Cat.ipynb' in your colab
